# Multimedia-Steganography Using Hybrid Encryption

## Introduction

Multimedia-Steganography Using Hybrid Encryption is a project that enables users to hide multiple files inside a video file using a hybrid encryption scheme combining features of AES and RSA algorithms. LSB Method is used in this project. The project facilitates the encryption of files, embedding them seamlessly within a video, and decrypting them from the encrypted video.

## Features

- **Hybrid Encryption**: Utilizes both AES and RSA algorithms for enhanced security.
- **File Hiding**: Enables hiding multiple files within a video file.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Allows users to encrypt files and embed them into a video, as well as decrypt files from the encrypted video.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and easy interface.
